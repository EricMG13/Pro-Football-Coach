# Build Status

The honest picture: what exists, what is verified, what is not.

**Read this first, before believing any other document about the state of the build.**

---

## Where the project actually is

**P0 and P1 are complete. There is a foundation, a model and two rules modules.**

### P1 — model and rules

`02` §11 did not exist; P1 needed league structure, scholarship limits, eligibility clocks, roster
sizes, the cap and the draft shape, and canon named none of them. Per the doc-first amendment rule
they went into `docs/02-GAME-DESIGN.md` §11 first. `02` also gained §11.3.1 (both tiers share one
21-week counter, because one save runs both leagues), §11.3.2 (decline ages), §11.3.3 (the trait
roster) and §11.3.4 (the scheme roster).

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| G1 build | green |
| G2 tests | 137 tests, 690 checks, all passed |
| G4 scope | model and rules only; no engine, no generation, no view |

**The phase-end review found a cross-process determinism bug this phase's own commit message claimed
to have closed.** `Player.traits` was a `Set<Trait>`, and `Set` encodes to an unkeyed container in
per-launch hash order — so the most-instantiated type in the save produced different bytes every
launch, with two traits enough to trigger it. It is fixed, and the suite is now byte-identical
across eight separate process invocations. Two lessons carried forward:

1. **A round-trip test cannot see an ordering bug**, because `Set` equality is order-independent and
   the hash seed is constant within a process. Only asserting the *encoded shape or bytes* can.
2. **The scan meant to prevent it looked at one spelling.** It now covers `Dictionary<K, V>` as well
   as `[K: V]`, bans a stored `Set` in `Model/`, and requires stored properties there to carry a
   type annotation — the inferred-literal case no annotation scan can otherwise see.

**What is NOT true yet:** nothing generates a league, nothing resolves a snap, and no rule is
*enforced* — `RosterLegality` is a predicate and P7 and P8 own enforcement. P2 starts generation.

### P0 — foundation

The spec package is complete and P0 has run: the repository is stripped to the four things
`docs/PORT-LOG.md` justifies keeping, the `03b` §1 module skeleton exists, the `03` §3 hierarchical
seeding contract is implemented and pinned by golden vectors at both the root and every derived
level, the four build-wide source scans live in `Tests/SimTests/Suites/ContractTests.swift`, and the
save envelope carries a version readable from a 16-byte header.

**Gates, run on this machine in the session that claims them, not cited from elsewhere:**

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| G1 build | green, `swift build` clean |
| G2 tests | 50 tests, 134 checks, all passed |
| G4 scope | diff matches `docs/plans/2026-08-09-p0-foundation.md`'s File Structure table |
| G6 determinism | golden vectors pin `seed(from:)` and `derive`; three separate process invocations byte-identical; both determinism source scans green |

**The suite shrank from 324 tests / 18,631 checks to 50 / 134.** That is the phase working — 88 of
93 tracked source and test files were deleted, including 90 arcade tests. The full accounting, with
the retrieval SHA, is in `docs/PORT-LOG.md`.

**What is NOT true yet:** there is no model, no rules module, no engine, no generation, no AI, no
design system and no view beyond a placeholder. P1 starts the model.

### What P0's adversarial review found, and what it means for later phases

The phase-end review planted six real violations in the tree and the suite reported all passed. Both
gates P0 exists to install had been shipped without being watched failing against the spellings a
real offender uses. All findings are fixed and each fix was verified by re-planting the violation and
watching the suite turn red; the detail is in the fix commit. Three consequences outlive P0:

1. **A self-test that only tries the idealised spelling is not evidence.** The first version of
   `ContractTests` caught `import SwiftUI` and missed `import struct SwiftUI.Color`; caught
   `.hashValue` and missed `Hasher()`; caught `Date()` and missed `Date.now`. Every scan a later
   phase adds owes a self-test over the *evasions*, not the textbook case.
2. **A scan over a hand-written list of directories is the coverage-boundary failure wearing a
   gate's clothes.** The ambient-identity scan named four directories, all empty, and covered
   nothing. It now walks the whole engine and exempts `Model/` by name.
3. **A gate that fails on compliant code will be weakened, not obeyed.** The design-token scan
   rejected `.padding(.horizontal, Token.gutter)`. P11 would have hit that on its first view.

### Known gaps in P0's scans, stated rather than left implicit

- **Literal colours are not covered.** `03b` §1's fourth token class is colour; the scan checks
  spacing, radius and font size only. This is the pattern set the plan deliberately scoped small.
  **P11 owns extending it**, and `04` §3's component registry is what makes that enumeration by
  construction rather than by memory.
- **The comment scanner does not understand raw strings or multiline literals.** A `#"…"#`
  containing a backslash could mis-track its closing quote. The failure direction is a false
  negative on a line no current pattern occupies. Revisit if the tree gains raw strings.

## D11(b) — who has a toolchain — **CLOSED 2026-08-09**

**The gates ran. Build green; 299 tests, 18,412 checks, all passed.** The machine that hosts this
session has the toolchain the earlier entries below could not find:

```
swift 6.3.3 (swiftlang-6.3.3.1.3)   Xcode 26.6 (17F113)
xcode-select: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
simctl: iPhone 17 / 17 Pro / 17 Pro Max / 17e / Air available, two booted
```

`./scripts/verify.sh` — written as an owner handoff — was run directly by the session: `swift build`
complete in 6.91 s, `swift run -c release SimTests` reporting `299 tests, 18412 checks, all passed`.

**Three things this does and does not mean.**

1. **G1 and G2 are agent-assertable from here.** Not by the egress-policy change D11 recommends, but
   because the session runs on the owner's Mac rather than in the sandboxed container the entries
   below describe. Same outcome as D11 option 1, reached by option 2's route, and without option 2's
   synchronous human step.
2. **This is not evidence the rebuild works.** Those 299 tests cover the *previous* build — arcade,
   dynasty, front office — most of which P0 deletes. What is verified is the **gate mechanism**: the
   harness compiles, runs, and reports real exit codes on this machine. Nothing about the rebuild is
   verified, because the rebuild does not exist.
3. **It re-escalates if the environment changes.** A session in a sandboxed agent container has none
   of the above, and the rules in `CLAUDE.md` for that case still stand in full. The claim is
   "verified on this machine, this session", never "verified everywhere".

The record of the container investigation is kept below, unedited, because it is what the decision
was made against and because the container case will recur.

### The original finding, retained

D11 was originally recorded as wholly blocking; on inspection it splits, and the correction unblocks
most of P0:

- **D11(a) — what framework runs the tests: decided.** The prior build already solved it and the
  solution is in the tree. `Tests/SimTests/TestKit.swift` is a ~50-line hand-rolled harness, zero
  dependencies, real exit codes, run as an executable target via `swift build && swift run -c release
  SimTests`. It needs only the Command Line Tools, not full Xcode. It carried 224 tests and 13,226
  assertions. Ported per `docs/PORT-LOG.md`.
- **D11(b) — who actually has a toolchain to run it: ~~still escalated~~ closed, see above.** It was
  an owner question, and the answer turned out to be operational: the owner's machine is where the
  sessions run.

Verified in the container this was originally written in, not assumed:

```
swift: NOT FOUND    swiftc: NOT FOUND    xcodebuild: NOT FOUND
xcrun: NOT FOUND    simctl: NOT FOUND    uname: Linux
```

Every sanctioned route was tested this session, not assumed: `download.swift.org` returns **403 on
CONNECT** through the egress proxy; Ubuntu 24.04's `swift` packages are the unrelated OpenStack
object store; there is no Docker daemon (`/var/run/docker.sock` does not exist). Routing around the
policy is forbidden, so there is no way to obtain a toolchain from inside an agent environment.

**Phase 4C of the previous build shipped having never been compiled as a direct result** — and the
failure was not the missing toolchain, it was claiming otherwise.

**This is now measured, not remembered.** The repo carried 70 MB of committed Xcode build products.
Symbol counts in both the 3.9 MB `FootballSimCore.o` and, independently, the 926 KB `.swiftmodule`
show `SeededRandom`, `GameSimulator`, `PlayCaller` and `LeagueFactory` present — and **zero symbols
from any of the ten tracked files in `Sources/FootballSimCore/Arcade/`**. The arcade layer was added
after the last build that succeeded. Detail in `docs/PORT-LOG.md`; the artifacts are now untracked
and gitignored.

**Handoff:** `scripts/verify.sh` runs build and tests and prints a pasteable result. It needs only
the Swift Command Line Tools, not full Xcode.

Every "tests green" gate in `05`, and the whole machine-verifiable half of the definition of done,
depended on D11(b). They no longer do — see the top of this section. Lifting the egress rule for
`download.swift.org` remains the right fix **if the build ever moves back into a container**; it is
no longer on the critical path.

## Owner decisions taken during the build

### 2026-08-10 — the app is landscape, not portrait

The owner reversed the orientation half of `CLAUDE.md`'s owner-fixed tech stack, citing FM as the
reference and reporting that FM Mobile is landscape throughout, menus included. That report is
**owner testimony, not capture** — the two FM Mobile screenshots in `01-RESEARCH.md` §6.6 are both
in-match — and it is recorded as testimony in AS-6.5-07.

**The geometry supports it, and the research had not checked.** `01-RESEARCH.md` §6.5 dismissed
landscape in a single uncomputed sentence ("would force either a 2.25:1 letterbox with the width
crushed, or horizontal panning"). Computed: the whole 120-yard field fits at **6.54 pt/yd** on the
base device, **6.28** on the mini class and **5.56** on the SE, with no pan and no between-snaps
recentring, against portrait's 7.31 pt/yd over 68 of 120 yards. About 11 % smaller marks for the
entire field, permanently. §6.5 now carries the correction and a scored option E.

**Changed:** `CLAUDE.md` tech stack, `README.md`, `PRODUCT.md` and `02` §12 non-goals,
`03b` §7, `04` §4 (new two-pane chassis and its three costs) and §5.1–§5.2 (rewritten) and §6 (new
`OrientationPolicyTest` row), `04b` §2 and its Adaptivity global checks, `05` P13,
`06-AUDIT-DISPOSITION.md` row 17, `01-RESEARCH.md` (six dated corrections, none rewriting what it
observed), and `App/project.yml`.

**Two consequences worth reading before P11.**

1. **Size classes are back.** Portrait made every supported iPhone compact-width — one case, which
   is why `04b` could exclude size classes. In landscape, Plus/Max report **regular** width and
   standard/SE report **compact**. A `NavigationSplitView` left to its defaults collapses at compact
   width, so the two-pane chassis is laid out explicitly and both classes are rendered in test.
2. **AX5 is now the binding accessibility constraint.** 369 pt of usable height, not 844.
   `DynamicTypeContractTest` is the contract test most likely to fail first.

**Verification.** `xcodegen generate` accepted the new `App/project.yml` and emits
`INFOPLIST_KEY_UISupportedInterfaceOrientations = "UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft
UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight"`. That is the whole of what was verified — no app target has
been built, because there are no views to build. Every device point size and safe-area inset in
`04` §5.2 remains **ASSUMPTION**; P13 measures them.

**Unresolved, and pointing the other way.** FM's own community reports the *vertical* pitch reads
better for team shape, lines and gaps (`01-RESEARCH.md` §2.1), and FM26 ships a *Vertical Scrolling*
camera. Whether that transfers to a sport whose structure is a line of scrimmage is settled by
nothing in the package. `05` P13's owner walkthrough asks it.

---

## Decisions made without owner input

The owner was asked and did not answer, so these were decided during execution and are marked
reversible. They are called out here because they are the ones most worth overturning if wrong:

- **D14 build order: college first.** The player starts there and both unsolved risks live there.
- **D14 league size: ~134 programmes**, with an explicit fallback to ~64 if D4's week-advance ceiling
  cannot be met at that scale.

---

## Caveats on the spec package itself

Stated plainly so nothing here is mistaken for more than it is.

1. **`04b` is reconstructed, not extracted.** The rubric was reverse-engineered from `AUDIT.md`'s
   evidence because `/impeccable` was not available. Re-run the tool and paste its rubric verbatim to
   make it authoritative.
2. **Three accessibility premises are UNVERIFIED.** The 44 pt touch-target floor, Apple's exact
   Reduce Motion semantics, and the SwiftUI API for suppressing `TimelineView` updates were cited
   from memory — `developer.apple.com` returned no readable body through the proxy. Confirm against
   the HIG before implementing D12.
3. **D1's timing constants are proposals, not measurements.** The seconds-per-call-in and
   seconds-per-drive-summary figures that the gate-zero arithmetic multiplies by need the owner
   protocol in `01-RESEARCH.md` §6.0 §8 and one layout measurement in Xcode.
4. **Recruiting-AI cost across ~134 programmes has never been measured.** D4's dominant
   week-advance term is an estimate. P5 of the plan is where it gets tested, and where D14's
   fallback fires if it fails.
5. **The engagement post-mortem's experiential half is unrun.** §6.0's static census is complete and
   its findings are strong — one mandatory decision per week, zero inbound events, jeopardy frozen
   for a season, 22 of 24 skill nodes inert. The play-session protocol is written but needs the owner
   and a running build.
6. **Most of the design documents have not been independently reviewed.** Only `01-RESEARCH.md` went
   through an adversarial critic — and a pre-push audit on 2026-08-09 (five lenses, every finding
   independently refuted before being accepted) confirmed 23 defects across the package, of which
   three were blockers. All 23 are fixed; the lesson is that the package had not been re-read against
   the tree after it was written.
7. **The legal guardrail violation is gone from the working tree, and remains in history.**
   `Sources/FootballSimCore/Generation/NameBank.swift` declared its college list "Fictional alma
   maters" while containing real NCAA institutions, and asserted "no real player is referenced" for
   a name cross product that cannot guarantee it. **P0 deleted it** along with the rest of
   `Generation/` (commit `37b10c3`). It is still reachable through `git show`, as every deleted file
   is, and `docs/PORT-LOG.md` keeps it as the worked example P2's collision test exists to catch.

## What the previous build was

Retained as Tier B evidence, not as a mandate. Its engine was calibrated, had 224 tests and 13,226
assertions, a ten-season soak, cross-process determinism (fixed the hard way — `UUID.hashValue` is
salted per launch), and bounded save growth (8.3 MB → 2.3 MB). Its UI scored 9/20. Its management
week contained one mandatory decision.

Full detail in `docs/AUDIT.md` and `docs/01-RESEARCH.md` §6.0.
