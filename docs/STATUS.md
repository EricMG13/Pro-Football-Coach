# Build Status

The honest picture: what exists, what is verified, what is not.

**Read this first, before believing any other document about the state of the build.**

---

## Where the project actually is

**The spec package is complete. No line of the rebuild has been written.**

The v4 brief (`docs/reviews/2026-08-09-spec-prompt-v4.md`) has been executed: research, design,
architecture, plan, decisions and the build prompt all exist and are internally consistent. Phase P0
of `docs/05-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` has not started. **It is no longer blocked** — see D11 below.

The previous build's source is still in the tree (`Sources/`, `Tests/`, `App/`). Under Tier C it has
**no authority**. It has not been deleted, because deleting it is P0's business and P0 has not run.
Do not treat anything in `Sources/` as canon; `docs/DOC-MANIFEST.md` is the authority on what is.

## What exists, and what verified it

| Artefact | State | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Rewritten as Deliverable 0 | Read by hand; consistent with `08` |
| `docs/DOC-MANIFEST.md` + archival | Done; anti-canon moved to `docs/archive/` | `git status` shows the moves; `README.md` repointed |
| `docs/01-RESEARCH.md` | 7,300 lines, §6.0–§6.5 plus carried-forward §A–§H | Adversarial completeness critic; two defects found and fixed |
| `docs/04b-AUDIT-RUBRIC.md` | Reconstructed from `AUDIT.md` evidence | **Not** extracted from the tool — see caveat below |
| `docs/02-GAME-DESIGN.md` | Written | Not independently reviewed |
| `docs/03-MATCH-ENGINE.md` | Written | Not independently reviewed |
| `docs/03b-ARCHITECTURE.md` | Written | Not independently reviewed |
| `docs/04-UX-AND-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` | Written | Not independently reviewed |
| `docs/05-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` | Written | Not independently reviewed |
| `docs/06-AUDIT-DISPOSITION.md` | 25 P0/P1s + 5 patterns dispositioned | Finding titles extracted mechanically from `AUDIT.md` |
| `docs/OPEN-DECISIONS.md` | D1–D14, each with an instrumented falsifier | D11 **closed 2026-08-09** by running the gates; the rest undecided as marked |
| `docs/PRE-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` | Authored | — |
| `docs/08-OPUS5-BUILD-PROMPT.md` | Written as a phase-entry prompt | — |
| `PRODUCT.md` | Rewritten from the §6.3 gap argument | — |

**Nothing in this table has been compiled, because there is nothing to compile yet.**

## D11(b) — who has a toolchain — **CLOSED 2026-08-09**

**The gates ran. Build green; 299 tests, 18,412 checks, all passed.** The machine that hosts this
session has the toolchain the earlier entries below could not find:

```
swift 6.3.3 (swiftlang-6.3.3.1.3)   Xcode 26.6 (17F113)
xcode-select: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
simctl: iPhone 17 / 17 Pro / 17 Pro Max / 17e / Air available, two booted
```

`./scripts/verify.sh` — written as an owner handoff — was run directly by the session: `swift build`
complete in 6.91 s, `swift run -c release SimTests` reporting `299 tests, 18412 checks, all passed`.

**Three things this does and does not mean.**

1. **G1 and G2 are agent-assertable from here.** Not by the egress-policy change D11 recommends, but
   because the session runs on the owner's Mac rather than in the sandboxed container the entries
   below describe. Same outcome as D11 option 1, reached by option 2's route, and without option 2's
   synchronous human step.
2. **This is not evidence the rebuild works.** Those 299 tests cover the *previous* build — arcade,
   dynasty, front office — most of which P0 deletes. What is verified is the **gate mechanism**: the
   harness compiles, runs, and reports real exit codes on this machine. Nothing about the rebuild is
   verified, because the rebuild does not exist.
3. **It re-escalates if the environment changes.** A session in a sandboxed agent container has none
   of the above, and the rules in `CLAUDE.md` for that case still stand in full. The claim is
   "verified on this machine, this session", never "verified everywhere".

The record of the container investigation is kept below, unedited, because it is what the decision
was made against and because the container case will recur.

### The original finding, retained

D11 was originally recorded as wholly blocking; on inspection it splits, and the correction unblocks
most of P0:

- **D11(a) — what framework runs the tests: decided.** The prior build already solved it and the
  solution is in the tree. `Tests/SimTests/TestKit.swift` is a ~50-line hand-rolled harness, zero
  dependencies, real exit codes, run as an executable target via `swift build && swift run -c release
  SimTests`. It needs only the Command Line Tools, not full Xcode. It carried 224 tests and 13,226
  assertions. Ported per `docs/PORT-LOG.md`.
- **D11(b) — who actually has a toolchain to run it: ~~still escalated~~ closed, see above.** It was
  an owner question, and the answer turned out to be operational: the owner's machine is where the
  sessions run.

Verified in the container this was originally written in, not assumed:

```
swift: NOT FOUND    swiftc: NOT FOUND    xcodebuild: NOT FOUND
xcrun: NOT FOUND    simctl: NOT FOUND    uname: Linux
```

Every sanctioned route was tested this session, not assumed: `download.swift.org` returns **403 on
CONNECT** through the egress proxy; Ubuntu 24.04's `swift` packages are the unrelated OpenStack
object store; there is no Docker daemon (`/var/run/docker.sock` does not exist). Routing around the
policy is forbidden, so there is no way to obtain a toolchain from inside an agent environment.

**Phase 4C of the previous build shipped having never been compiled as a direct result** — and the
failure was not the missing toolchain, it was claiming otherwise.

**This is now measured, not remembered.** The repo carried 70 MB of committed Xcode build products.
Symbol counts in both the 3.9 MB `FootballSimCore.o` and, independently, the 926 KB `.swiftmodule`
show `SeededRandom`, `GameSimulator`, `PlayCaller` and `LeagueFactory` present — and **zero symbols
from any of the ten tracked files in `Sources/FootballSimCore/Arcade/`**. The arcade layer was added
after the last build that succeeded. Detail in `docs/PORT-LOG.md`; the artifacts are now untracked
and gitignored.

**Handoff:** `scripts/verify.sh` runs build and tests and prints a pasteable result. It needs only
the Swift Command Line Tools, not full Xcode.

Every "tests green" gate in `05`, and the whole machine-verifiable half of the definition of done,
depended on D11(b). They no longer do — see the top of this section. Lifting the egress rule for
`download.swift.org` remains the right fix **if the build ever moves back into a container**; it is
no longer on the critical path.

## Decisions made without owner input

The owner was asked and did not answer, so these were decided during execution and are marked
reversible. They are called out here because they are the ones most worth overturning if wrong:

- **D14 build order: college first.** The player starts there and both unsolved risks live there.
- **D14 league size: ~134 programmes**, with an explicit fallback to ~64 if D4's week-advance ceiling
  cannot be met at that scale.

---

## Caveats on the spec package itself

Stated plainly so nothing here is mistaken for more than it is.

1. **`04b` is reconstructed, not extracted.** The rubric was reverse-engineered from `AUDIT.md`'s
   evidence because `/impeccable` was not available. Re-run the tool and paste its rubric verbatim to
   make it authoritative.
2. **Three accessibility premises are UNVERIFIED.** The 44 pt touch-target floor, Apple's exact
   Reduce Motion semantics, and the SwiftUI API for suppressing `TimelineView` updates were cited
   from memory — `developer.apple.com` returned no readable body through the proxy. Confirm against
   the HIG before implementing D12.
3. **D1's timing constants are proposals, not measurements.** The seconds-per-call-in and
   seconds-per-drive-summary figures that the gate-zero arithmetic multiplies by need the owner
   protocol in `01-RESEARCH.md` §6.0 §8 and one layout measurement in Xcode.
4. **Recruiting-AI cost across ~134 programmes has never been measured.** D4's dominant
   week-advance term is an estimate. P5 of the plan is where it gets tested, and where D14's
   fallback fires if it fails.
5. **The engagement post-mortem's experiential half is unrun.** §6.0's static census is complete and
   its findings are strong — one mandatory decision per week, zero inbound events, jeopardy frozen
   for a season, 22 of 24 skill nodes inert. The play-session protocol is written but needs the owner
   and a running build.
6. **Most of the design documents have not been independently reviewed.** Only `01-RESEARCH.md` went
   through an adversarial critic — and a pre-push audit on 2026-08-09 (five lenses, every finding
   independently refuted before being accepted) confirmed 23 defects across the package, of which
   three were blockers. All 23 are fixed; the lesson is that the package had not been re-read against
   the tree after it was written.
7. **The legal guardrail is currently violated in shipped code, and P0 removes the violation.**
   `Sources/FootballSimCore/Generation/NameBank.swift` declares its college list "Fictional alma
   maters" while containing real NCAA institutions, and asserts "no real player is referenced" for a
   name cross product that cannot guarantee it. This is on the public repository now. It is not
   patched, because P0 deletes `Generation/` entirely; it is recorded in `docs/PORT-LOG.md` as the
   worked example P2's collision test exists to catch. **If P0 slips, this becomes a patch, not a
   note.**

## What the previous build was

Retained as Tier B evidence, not as a mandate. Its engine was calibrated, had 224 tests and 13,226
assertions, a ten-season soak, cross-process determinism (fixed the hard way — `UUID.hashValue` is
salted per launch), and bounded save growth (8.3 MB → 2.3 MB). Its UI scored 9/20. Its management
week contained one mandatory decision.

Full detail in `docs/AUDIT.md` and `docs/01-RESEARCH.md` §6.0.
